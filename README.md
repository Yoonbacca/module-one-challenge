# Module 1 Challenge - Landing Page Code Refactoring

![Alt text](/Develop/assets/images/readme-screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

## Description
This is a simple landing page for a fictional company, Horiseon. The website was cloned from the starter code housed in https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.

The purpose of this exercise was to illustrate the importance of accessible web design. The starter code was structured sequentially, however, the html contained no semantic elements, alt text, or descriptive titles.

I was able to replace all of the parent divs with their respective semantic counterparts. I also added alt images to all of the presented pictures except for one. The background image below the header was inserted via CSS. From what I read online, alt text is only necessary for non-ambient imagery, so I decided to keep this image without a descriptor as it does not have any importance to the content on the page.

The title was also given a more descriptive title while the header was mainly unchanged. I noticed a span for the string 'seo', so I inspected the CSS and noticed that it was supposed to be a different color. I had not noticed that 'seo' was another color in my first passthroughs, so I decided to add a bit more color to allow it to pop more. I had difficulty making the color AA compliant since it's supposed to contrast with both the background and surrounding text. I decided to focus more on making contrast with the surrounding text more and made it a different shade of blue.

## How to Install and Run the Project 
You can either clone the repo and preview index.html within an IDE or access the page at https://yoonbacca.github.io/module-one-challenge/


## How to Use the Project
You can use this project as a reference for how an accessible webpage should be structured. Since the project was more concerned with html structure, one should not use this as a reference to create their own landing pages.
